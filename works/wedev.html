        <li>Website for Shiksha Setu : College NGO like Club </li>
        <li>(Social WebApp exclusively for my college students)LoopSpace : The main idea behind it was to build a strong communication and awareness system among the
            students of the campus.It is a Web-based system that allows its registered members to establish relationships with other
            members and to share different types of information that includes personal data, contacts, multimedia
            resources. They can share the job-related details posted by fellow mates via adding a post which can be
            read by all the students using the website, and hence everyone will be updated.</li>
